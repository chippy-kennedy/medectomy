Chippy is up and running with ubuntu and back to coding on laptop. I have the base MVC layout for the Beta Launch,
details to follow. Will update my progress as I go. Plan to implement another 4-5 objects into the database models.
Plan to generate about 5-6 blank views. And layout the basic controller code to make it work.

MJ: We need to discuss my implementation of the database models.
Abdallah: You need to double check any controller code.
General layout/theme/Medectomy_Beta CSS model for our views to come soon as well.

Stay posted in Base Camp and Git.
