with other non-enveloped RNA viruses, the Norovirus is primarily transmitted
via the <b><span style='font-weight:bold'>fecal-oral route.</span></b>  Within
humans, its infection is hallmarked by acute gastrointestinal symptoms such as <b><span
style='font-weight:bold'>nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. </span></b> <b><span
style='font-weight:bold'>Fever</span></b> may also be present.  The Norovirus
can be differentiated from the Rotavirus (another cause of acute GI distress)
due to the presence of vomiting and the fact that it tends to infect<b><span
style='font-weight:bold'> older children and adults</span></b>.  Outbreaks of
the Norovirus tend to happen yearly worldwide, and they commonly occur in areas
where individuals are in <b><span style='font-weight:bold'>close proximity </span></b>with
one another.  Due to this, Norovirus outbreaks are common within households and
on <b><span style='font-weight:bold'>cruise ships</span></b>.  By and large,
Norovirus infections are self-limiting and resolve within several days.  Viral
shedding continues for several weeks following infection, however.<sup>13</sup></span></font></p>
