viral families which fit into the category of enveloped RNA viruses.  One of
the simplest ways to organize these viral families is by looking at the

example, an easy way to initially divide the enveloped RNA viruses is by
whether they have a positive sense or negative sense RNA genome.  </span></font></p>

viruses can be remembered using the pneumonic “ Always brings polymerase or
fails replication.” This pneumonic is relevant to the normal functioning of
negative sense viruses, since they must carry an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
with them into the cell in order to replicate.  The negative sense, enveloped
RNA viruses can be divided further based upon genome segmentation.  As stated
earlier, the Bunyavirus Family, Orthomyxovirus Family, and Arenavirus Family
have segmented genomes.  The remainder of the negative sense, enveloped RNA
